# Hypothesis-testing-with-Chi-Square
In this case study I perform a chi-square test with the data from the Eniac, applying a post-hoc correction to perform pairwise tests and find the true winner.
This is what the homepage currently looks like:

## Business Challenge

The white “SHOP NOW” button is prominently featured in the primary banner, yet it only attracts about 2% of users. This click-through rate (CTR) is a common metric in online marketing, representing the number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of times the ad is shown. In this context, CTR is measured as the number of clicks a website element receives divided by the total number of website visits. The team analyzing the website provided specific numbers and their reactions:

During the sample period from October 13, 2021, to October 20, 2021, which included 50,061 homepage visits, just under 2% of users clicked “SHOP NOW.” This button attracted about twice as many users as the “iPhone” link in the left sidebar but had a lower CTR compared to the surrounding banner, which achieved roughly 3.5%. The team questioned whether the visual features of the “SHOP NOW” button or the text itself might be too immediate a commitment for users.

In an A/B test, the UX team typically performs user research and develops a new version of the website element to be tested. They conducted an anonymous user survey, showing a de-branded mock-up of the homepage and asking, “What do you think and feel when you see this ‘SHOP NOW’ button on an online retailer’s website?” Here are a few recorded responses:

Holly, 32:
“I’m on a shopping site, so it seems pretty natural to me. I would probably click it if I knew which items it would take me to.”

Ed, 57:

“I like to do my research before I put anything in a basket. I’d like to see some product specs before I’m ready to ‘shop’.”

V., 16

“Seems a little unnecessary. I came here to shop, so why is the website telling me to shop?”

, to find out which button performs best for the online shop. 


## Summary
This case study focuses on revenue generation. Together with the data team, I will be evaluating a test to determine which version of a website feature converts more visits into sales.
